            There are no accounts! Over the past few years, the web has become a
            weird corporate place, with everybody asking for your email. It's a
            small piece of the larger problem of people not being in control of
            their own personal data.
          </p>
          <p className={PARAGRAPH_CLASS_NAMES}>
            Poketo strives to be a good internet citizen. The only data we save
            is what series you're following and when you last read them. We
            don't know who you are, and we don't want to! That's part of what
            makes Poketo fast, light, and fun.

            Honestly, I'm not sure. I know a lot of work goes into translating
            series, and I don't want Poketo to take away from traffic, ad
            revenue or other ways scanlators support their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm open to figuring something out though. If you're a scanlator and
            have opinions about how Poketo can help, let me know!

            There's a few other sneaky ways to use Poketo. First, you can read
            series on{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/poketo/lib">supported sites</a> by
            pasting their URLs into [insert link to page with search bar]. You
            can also use [insert link to bookmarklet] when you're on another
            site. You can also get an RSS feed for any series by appending{' '}
            <code>.rss</code> to the URL.
