          There are no accounts! Over the past few years, the web has become a
          weird corporate place, with everybody asking for your email. It's a
          small piece of the larger problem of people not being in control of
          their own personal data.

          Poketo strives to be a good internet citizen. The only data we save is
          what series you're following and when you last read them. We don't
          know who you are, and we don't want to! That's part of what makes
          Poketo fast, light, and fun.
