> Friendly web-based manga reader

A lightweight tool for reading and keeping track of manga series. Sorta like a manga RSS reader. If you'd like an invite, check out [poketo.app](https://poketo.app).

> :construction: Poketo is still in development. It's usable, but watch your step! You might run into some bugs.

### Features

* **simple**: no accounts, no downloads, no ads.
* **inline reader**: read new chapters in a simple reader with just a tap
* **web-based**: read on a phone, computer, tablet, wherever!
* **open-source**: all the scraping logic can be reused with [the node library](https://github.com/poketo/poketo)
* **offline-ready**: downloading chapters for offline _(coming soon)_

### Motivation

People should be able to read content on the web in the way that works for them. Manga reader sites are a special brand of bad. Each page in a chapter is a new page load, ads everywhere, yuck!

Poketo provides a nice experience to follow and read series across the web. It's also built using an [extensible javascript library](https://github.com/poketo/poketo) and [micro-service](https://github.com/poketo/service) so anyone else can build their own reader and share the work behind Poketo! Be free, internet content!

### Contributing

Issues and PR's are welcome! Feel free to drop a note on this repo, the [micro-service repo](https://github.com/poketo/service), or [the library repo](https://github.com/poketo/poketo).

#### Colophon

Deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Built with React, Redux, and Flow.
