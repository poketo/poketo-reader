Poketo is lightweight web app for following and reading [scanlated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation) manga series. It scrapes scanlator sites to track series updates and provide a nice reading experience.

Currently in beta.

For an invite, check out [poketo.app â†’](https://poketo.app)

### Features

* **simple**: no accounts, no downloads, no ads
* **track series**: fetches updates from [14+ manga sites](https://github.com/poketo/node#supported-sites)
* **inline reader**: read new chapters with just a tap
* **web-based**: use on a phone, computer, tablet, wherever!
* **open-source**: anyone can contribute or build features on top
* _coming soon:_ **offline-ready**: save chapters for offline reading

:construction: Poketo is still in beta. It's usable, but watch your step! You might run into some bugs.

## Motivation

People should be able to read content on the web in the way that works for them. Manga reader sites are a special brand of bad. Each page in a chapter is a new page load, ads everywhere, yuck!

Poketo provides a nice experience to follow and read series across the web. It's also built using an [extensible javascript library](https://github.com/poketo/poketo) and [micro-service](https://github.com/poketo/service) so anyone else can build their own reader and share the work behind Poketo! Be free, internet content!

## Contributing

Issues and PR's are welcome! Feel free to drop a note on this repo, the [micro-service repo](https://github.com/poketo/service), or [the library repo](https://github.com/poketo/poketo).
