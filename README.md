A lightweight tool for reading and keeping track of manga series. Sorta like a manga RSS reader.

:construction: Poketo is still in development. It's usable, but watch your step! You might run into some bugs.

### Motivation

People should be able to read content on the web in the way that works for them. Manga reader sites are a special brand of bad. Each page in a chapter is a new page load, ads everywhere, yuck!

Poketo provides a nice experience to follow and read series across the web. It's also built using an [extensible javascript library](https://github.com/poketo/poketo) and [micro-service](https://github.com/poketo/service) so anyone else can build their own reader and share the work behind Poketo! Be free, internet content!

## Colophon

Deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Built with React, Redux, and Flow.
