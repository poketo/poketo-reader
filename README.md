> Friendly web-based manga reader

A lightweight web app for following and reading scanlated manga series. Scrapes scanlator sites to make tracking updates and reading series easier. Currently in beta.

For an invite, check out [poketo.app](https://poketo.app).

### Features

* **simple**: no accounts, no downloads, no ads.
* **track series**: fetches updates from [14+ manga sites](https://github.com/poketo/node#supported-sites)
* **inline reader**: read new chapters in a simple reader with just a tap
* **web-based**: read on a phone, computer, tablet, wherever!
* **open-source**: anyone can contribute or build features on top
* _coming soon:_ **offline-ready**: downloading chapters for offline

:construction: Poketo is still in beta. It's usable, but watch your step! You might run into some bugs.

## Motivation

People should be able to read content on the web in the way that works for them. Manga reader sites are a special brand of bad. Each page in a chapter is a new page load, ads everywhere, yuck!

Poketo provides a nice experience to follow and read series across the web. It's also built using an [extensible javascript library](https://github.com/poketo/poketo) and [micro-service](https://github.com/poketo/service) so anyone else can build their own reader and share the work behind Poketo! Be free, internet content!

## Contributing

Issues and PR's are welcome! Feel free to drop a note on this repo, the [micro-service repo](https://github.com/poketo/service), or [the library repo](https://github.com/poketo/poketo).
